Her mother, Susan, was not only Emily's parent but also her best friend, confidante, and partner in crime. Together they explored every corner of their small world—whether it be the hidden gems within nature trails or diving into treasured novels that transported them to fantastical realms. Susan was known for her quirky charm; she would always leave a trail of rose petals on Emily's bed and whisper sweet affirmations in the morning, reminding her of their unshakable bond.\\n\\n**Subplots:**  \\nEmily moved to New Hope High School after her mother's passing, grappling with not only her grief but also the challenge of fitting into a new environment where she felt like an outcast.

During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, yielding 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. However, these ATPs are produced through substrate-level phosphorylation and not by oxidative phosphorylation directly. Similarly, in the citric acid cycle, while energy carriers such as NADH and FADH₂ are generated, which will eventually be used to produce ATP via the electron transport chain, the cycle itself doesn't generate ATP directly. Instead, it primarily produces reduced coenzymes that carry electrons to the electron transport chain where oxidative phosphorylation occurs.\""
